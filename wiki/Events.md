#Events

Events are Bolt's way of setting up a RPC-like call over the network.



#### *Calling* a global event (global events are always reliable):

```C#
using(var evnt = ChangeDoorState.Raise(Bolt.GlobalTargets.Everyone))  
{  
        evnt.isOpen = b;  
}
```

#### *Calling* an entity event (entity events are unreliable):

```C#
using(var casingEvnt = SpawnCasing.Raise(entity))
{
    casingEvnt.cPosition = weaponStatsScript.caseEjectionPoint.position;
    casingEvnt.gunRef = correctIndex;
}
```

#### *Receiving* an event:
Make sure your script inherits from either:  

	Bolt.GlobalEventListener  
or  

	Bolt.EntityEventListener / Bolt.EntityEventListener<StateNameGoesHere> 
    
*(Note: These inherit from Bolt.EntityBehaviour already)*

Then, to receive an event:

```C#
public override void OnEvent (ChangeDoorState evnt)
{
    if(evnt.isOpen == true)
        SendMessage("PlayLinkedSound");  
}
```
