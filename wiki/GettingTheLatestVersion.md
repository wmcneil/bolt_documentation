# Getting Bolt

### Getting the latest version

If you purchased Bolt through the Unity Asset Store, the best way to get the latest version of Bolt is by going to [http://www.boltengine.com/AssetStore.aspx](http://www.boltengine.com/AssetStore.aspx) and punching in your asset store invoice number, this lets you always access the latest version of Bolt without having to wait for the Asset Store update to process.

If you purchased Bolt through our site, you should have been supplied a download link on the return page after your purchase, if you have for some reason lost this link, email [support@boltengine.com](support@boltengine.com) to receive a new one. We also send out a link for every release of Bolt to your email. 

### Getting Bolt from the Private Repository

*Once you've been given access to the [official repository](https://github.com/BoltEngine/bolt) _(link will not work if you don't have access, see above)_ then you can log in to Github and access the full repository*.

You can either pull the repository and compile it yourself or pick one of the latest binary releases. You can find the releases at the root of the repository under *Releases* at the top, that would bring you to [*Bolt Releases*](https://github.com/BoltEngine/bolt/releases).
