# Getting Bolt

### Getting the latest version

If you purchased Bolt through the Unity Asset Store, the best way to get the latest version of Bolt is by going to [http://www.boltengine.com/AssetStore.aspx](http://www.boltengine.com/AssetStore.aspx) and punching in your asset store invoice number, this lets you always access the latest version of Bolt without having to wait for the Asset Store update to process.

If you purchased Bolt through our site, you should have been supplied a download link on the return page after your purchase, if you have for some reason lost this link, email [support@boltengine.com](support@boltengine.com) to receive a new one. We also send out a link for every release of Bolt to your email. 

If you send your Github username along with invoice number to [support@boltengine.com](support@boltengine.com) you should also get access to the Github repository.

### Getting Bolt from the Private Repository

**To access the links here you need access to the private repository; see above on how to get such access. Otherwise the links will appear invalid.**

Once you've been given access to the [official repository](https://github.com/BoltEngine/bolt) then you can log in to Github and access the full repository containing the latest binary releases.

You can either pull the repository and compile it yourself or pick one of the latest binary releases. You can find the releases at the root of the repository under *Releases* at the top, that would bring you to [*Bolt Releases*](https://github.com/BoltEngine/bolt/releases).
