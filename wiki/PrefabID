The Prefab ID

each prefab which is compiled gets a unique id which is also refered as the "Prefab id"

Uses of the Prefab id

the prefab id can be used for instantiating bolt prefabs with their ID.
which means that lets say that u wanna make a drop system for objetcs in your game,
and u wanna transmit a prefab in an event, you just add a new property to your event
lets say "Itemtodrop" and define him as "Prefab id" and then do something like:

void DropItem()
{
	using(var evnt = DropItemEvent.Raise(Bolt.GlobalTargets.Server))
	{
		evnt.Itemtodrop = Item.DropPrefab.GetCompoment<BoltEntity>().ModifySettings().prefabid;
		
		//ModifySettings - this isnt for editing the entity, its for getting the modifysettings of it.
	}
}

override OnEvent(DropItemEvent evnt)
{

BoltNetwork.Instantiate(evnt.Itemtodrop); //Instantiate a prefab with the prefab id that we transmited in the event.

}
