# State Replication

To replicate a value means to reproduce the value over a network/connection on the other machine. Bolt makes it easy for you to define what is important to be transferred over the Network by defining a **State**.

The *State* of a *BoltEntity* can **only** be modified by the *Owner*. Trying to change the State from somewhere else than the Owner will mean the value will not get replicated over the network.

### Mecanim/State interaction/Modifying state properties

Remember to link your Animator/Transform when your state is attached, eg. (in a script that inherits from `Bolt.EntityBehaviour<YourStateNameHere>`):

```C#
public override void Attached ()
{
    state.transform.SetTransforms(transform);
    state.SetAnimator(GetComponentInChildren<Animator>()); //Or wherever your animator is
}
```

After that, if your state properties are all set up properly in-editor, then all you have to do is change the linked properties, and your Animator should replicate as intended.  
In-editor example of Mecanim properties in state: [http://i.imgur.com/yWHrE1Z.png](http://i.imgur.com/yWHrE1Z.png)  
Then, to change the properties (this is not mecanim-specific, this method can be used to change any property): In a script that inherits from: `Bolt.EntityBehaviour<YourStateNamehere>`

```C#
using(var mod = state.Modify())
{ 
    mod.RunningSpeed = currentSpeed;
}
```

Then, as long as the controller is the only one running that bit of code (eg: wrap that in a `if(BoltNetwork.isOwner)` loop), Bolt will replicate that variable across the network, and push it into that animator automatically, if your state properties are set up as shown above.

### Replicate to Controller

By default Bolt will replicate the values to all Clients that are *not* the Controller. To enable *Replicate to Controller* one needs to enable the Joystick icon in the State's property in the *Bolt Editor* (Bolt 0.4+).

#### When to use Replicate to Controller?

It makes sense to **keep this turned off** when:

1. It's a property that you want to allow the Controller to have full control over.
2. It's a property that will be updated by the resulting state you receive from the Server/Owner in `ExecuteCommand()` where `resetState==true`.

On the other hand you would **turn this on** if:

1. It's a property that the Owner/Server will set and the Controller won't then you'll need to turn this on to receive the value of the property on the Controller's end.
